## Policies for Electric Vehicles Adoption: Evidence from Beijing
[**_Job Market Paper_** ðŸš—](https://wendy-wentian.github.io/files/Wen_Tian_JMP_PSU.pdf)
:   > **_Abstract:_** In response to global climate change and environmental problems, policymakers around the world have implemented various initiatives to promote electric vehicle (EV) adoption. I employ a structural model to evaluate the impacts of two demand-side interventions: EV subsidies and the green license plate (GLP) policy on EV adoption and examines the welfare impacts of these two policies. Using data from China's automobile industry, I estimate a demand model for vehicles that endogenizes consumer choices for license plates while accounting for consumer demographic heterogeneity. On the supply side, I estimate marginal costs based on Nash-Bertrand pricing. My counterfactual analysis indicates that the GLP policy was remarkably effective in boosting EV sales, equivalent to approximately $7,839 per EV in subsidies in Beijing, 2015. However, while it was effective in increasing sales, the policy also led to greater market power for EV producers, resulting in higher EV prices. When considering environmental externalities, both the EV subsidies and the GLP policy enhance net welfare surplus by 3.16% and 6.84%, respectively. Furthermore, I analyze the optimal level of EV subsidies in conjunction with the GLP policy and propose alternative policy designs that could be more efficient than the current practices in Beijing.

## Heterogeneous Impacts of Vertical Restraints Antitrust Event? Evidence from China 
[**_Working Paper_**](https://wendy-wentian.github.io/files/Wen_Working_Paper_PSU.pdf)
:   > **_Abstract:_** I examine the impacts of vertical restraints antitrust practices on consumer and producer behaviors in the auto market, using China's first antitrust case (the 2014 Audi case) as an exogenous shock, and investigate the persistence of these impacts. Using a combination of difference-in-differences and demand estimation methods, I find that the 2014 antitrust event led to a 4% decrease in prices set by Audi automakers and an 84% increase in sales of Audi. Leveraging novel transaction-level data, I study the differences between transaction prices set by dealers and manufacturers' suggested retail prices (MSRP) to determine whether the event led to significant changes in the vertical relationship. The results show that the transaction price to MSRP ratio did not decrease significantly after the event, implying no observed increase in dealers' market power. I conclude that the antitrust case on automakers' price control actions is likely to be a one-shot market shock in China's auto market.

## Tips and hints

* Name a file ".md" to have it render in markdown, name it ".html" to render in HTML.
* Go to the [commit list](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/commits/master) (on your repo) to find the last version Github built with Jekyll. 
  * Green check: successful build
  * Orange circle: building
  * Red X: error
  * No icon: not built

## Resources
 * [Liquid syntax guide](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/)
 * [MathJax Documentation](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/)

## MathJax 

Support for MathJax Version 3.0 is included in the template:

$$
\displaylines{
\nabla \cdot E= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\\
\nabla \cdot B=0 \\\
\nabla \times E= -\partial_tB \\\
\nabla \times B  = \mu_0 \left(J + \varepsilon_0 \partial_t E \right)
}
$$

The default delimiters of `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` are supported for displayed mathematics, while `\\(...\\)` should be used for in-line mathematics (ex., \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\))

**Note** that since Academic Pages uses Markdown which cases some interference with MathJax and LaTeX for escaping characters and new lines, although [some workarounds exist](https://math.codidact.com/posts/278763/278772#answer-278772).

## Markdown guide

Academic Pages uses [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html) for Markdown rendering, which has some differences from other Markdown implementations such as GitHub's. In addition to this guide, please see the [kramdown Syntax page](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) for full documentation.

## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

Basic notices or call-outs are supported using the following syntax:

```markdown
**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to the line following paragraph.
{: .notice}
```

which wil render as:

```markdown
This is the regular text.[^1] This is more regular text.[^note]

[^1]: This is the footnote itself.
[^note]: This is another footnote.
```
