## The Roles of Subsidy and Green License Policy in Putting More Electric Vehicles on the Road: Evidence from Beijing [🚗]()
**_Job Market Paper_** <br>
:   **_Abstract:_** This study examines two electric vehicles (EVs) promotion policies in Beijing: EV subsidies and the green license plate policy (a practice in China that provides EVs distinctive license plates and exempts them from stringent license quota policy on vehicles) in encouraging the adoption of EVs in the early stages of their development. 
To estimate the demand for EVs influenced by these policies, I develop a two-stage discrete choice model to identify consumer preferences for both license plate types and vehicle models. This model is then used to quantify the welfare impacts of subsidies and the green license policy in Beijing from 2014 to 2015.
Counterfactual analysis reveals that the green license policy in Beijing is cost-effective in promoting EV sales, equivalent to approximately \$5839 in EV subsidies. 
However, the impact of the green license policy on consumer surplus largely depends on the number of firms competing in the EV market. Additionally, the study finds that neither EV subsidies nor the green license policy led to significant substitution between EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) during the sample period, indicating limited environmental gains from these EV promotion policies.
<!--Furthermore, the implementation of the license quota policy in Beijing resulted in estimated environmental gains of \$0.51 to \$1.19 billion, but also a total welfare loss of \$3.59 billion. When considering the license quota policy, the adoption of the green license policy and EV subsidies could efficiently improve overall welfare.
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of EV policies in putting more EVs on the road and underscore the critical role of government in promoting fuel-saving technologies. -->

## Heterogeneous Impacts of Vertical Restraints Antitrust Event? Evidence from China 
**_Working Paper_** <br>
:   **_Abstract:_** In this paper, I analyze the effects of China’s first antitrust case on the practice of resale price maintenance in the automobile market in August 2014. I investigate the impacts and duration of this event using a difference-in-differences framework. The results indicate that the antitrust case led to a negative sales impact of -9.108% on Audi products. However, the relationship between transaction prices set by dealers and manufacturers’ suggested retail prices (MSRP) set by manufacturers remained unchanged after the antitrust case, suggesting that the Audi antitrust event was
a one-time market shock.

## Tips and hints

* Name a file ".md" to have it render in markdown, name it ".html" to render in HTML.
* Go to the [commit list](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/commits/master) (on your repo) to find the last version Github built with Jekyll. 
  * Green check: successful build
  * Orange circle: building
  * Red X: error
  * No icon: not built

## Resources
 * [Liquid syntax guide](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/)
 * [MathJax Documentation](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/)

## MathJax 

Support for MathJax Version 3.0 is included in the template:

$$
\displaylines{
\nabla \cdot E= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\\
\nabla \cdot B=0 \\\
\nabla \times E= -\partial_tB \\\
\nabla \times B  = \mu_0 \left(J + \varepsilon_0 \partial_t E \right)
}
$$

The default delimiters of `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` are supported for displayed mathematics, while `\\(...\\)` should be used for in-line mathematics (ex., \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\))

**Note** that since Academic Pages uses Markdown which cases some interference with MathJax and LaTeX for escaping characters and new lines, although [some workarounds exist](https://math.codidact.com/posts/278763/278772#answer-278772).

## Markdown guide

Academic Pages uses [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html) for Markdown rendering, which has some differences from other Markdown implementations such as GitHub's. In addition to this guide, please see the [kramdown Syntax page](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) for full documentation.

## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

Basic notices or call-outs are supported using the following syntax:

```markdown
**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to the line following paragraph.
{: .notice}
```

which wil render as:

**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to the line following paragraph.
{: .notice}

### Footnotes

Footnotes can be useful for clarifying points in the text, or citing information.[^1] Markdown support numeric footnotes, as well as text as long as the values are unique.[^note]

```markdown
This is the regular text.[^1] This is more regular text.[^note]

[^1]: This is the footnote itself.
[^note]: This is another footnote.
```

[^1]: Such as this footnote.
[^note]: When using text for footnotes markers, no spaces are permitted in the name.
