Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the $$\color{CornflowerBlue}{\small \text{Department of Economics}}$$ at the $$\color{CornflowerBlue}{\normalsize\text{Pennsylvania State University}}$$. 

My research fields are $$\color{CornflowerBlue}{\text{Industrial Organization}}$$ and $$\color{CornflowerBlue}{\text{Applied Microeconomics}}$$. My current research is on the effects of policies promoting electric vehicles, such as subsidies and the green license plate policy, on consumer purchasing behaviors and firms' pricing strategies in the automobile industry.

Before my Ph.D., I obtained an M.Phil. in Economics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a B.A. in Economics from Fudan University.

I will be on the job market for the 2024-25 academic year. My CV can be found [here](https://wendy-wentian.github.io/files/Wen_Tian_PSU_CV.pdf). 

<!-- I received my M.Phil. in economics from CUHK, Hong Kong in 2019, and my B.A. in economics from Fudan University, China in 2016. -->

<!-- In my [Job Market Paper](), I develop a two-stage discrete choice model to estimate the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) under EV-promoting policies and conduct counterfactual analysis to study the welfare impacts of these policies in China.-->
