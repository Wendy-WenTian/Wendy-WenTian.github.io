I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Penn State University. My research interests are in industrial organization, applied microeconomics, and environmental economics. In my current research, I focus on the estimation of discrete choice demand models and the welfare effects of electric vehicles (EVs) promotion policies.

I will be on the job market for the 2024-25 academic year. My CV can be found [here](https://wendy-wentian.github.io/files/Wen_Tian_PSU_CV.pdf).
