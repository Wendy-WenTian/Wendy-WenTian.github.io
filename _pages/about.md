I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Penn State University. 

<!-- I received my M.Phil. in economics from CUHK, Hong Kong in 2024, and my B.A. in economics from Fudan University, China in 2016. -->

My research interests are in industrial organization, applied microeconomics, and environmental economics. In my current research, I am focusing on estimating discrete choice demand models and conducting welfare analysis of policies promoting electric vehicles (EVs) in China.

I will be on the job market for the 2024-25 academic year. My CV can be found [here](https://wendy-wentian.github.io/files/Wen_Tian_PSU_CV.pdf).
